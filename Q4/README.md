# Q4 — AI-Generated Food Delivery App

## Approach

This app was generated using Claude (Anthropic) with two iterative prompts. The first prompt established the complete app scaffold with clean architecture, all entities, state management, screens, and mock data. The second prompt refined visual polish and UI interactions.

### Architecture

- **Clean Architecture**: `domain/` → `data/` → `presentation/` separation within a `features/food_delivery/` feature module
- **State Management**: flutter_bloc (Cubit pattern) with sealed class states for exhaustive pattern matching
- **Dependency Injection**: get_it — singletons for datasources/repositories, factory for screen-scoped cubits, lazySingleton for CartCubit (persists across navigation)
- **Immutable State**: All states use Equatable; mutations via copyWith only

### Key Design Decisions

1. **CartCubit as lazySingleton** — Cart state must survive navigation pushes/pops. Registered as lazySingleton in GetIt and provided via `BlocProvider.value` (not auto-disposed).

2. **Multi-restaurant cart guard** — When adding an item from a different restaurant, an AlertDialog confirms clearing the existing cart before switching.

3. **OrderCubit Timer lifecycle** — `Timer.periodic` advances order status every 5 seconds. Timer is cancelled both on delivery completion and in the cubit's `close()` override to prevent memory leaks.

4. **Sealed class states** — Using Dart 3 sealed classes enables exhaustive `switch` in BlocBuilder, ensuring every state (initial, loading, loaded, error) is handled.

5. **BlocSelector for CartBadge** — Rebuilds only when `itemCount` changes, not on every cart state mutation (e.g., quantity changes don't cause unnecessary AppBar rebuilds).

### Screens

| Screen | Description |
|---|---|
| Restaurant List | Browse 6 restaurants with image cards, ratings, delivery info |
| Food Menu | Restaurant header + scrollable menu items with "Add to Cart" |
| Checkout | Cart items with +/- quantity, price breakdown, "Place Order" |
| Order Tracking | Auto-advancing status stepper (confirmed → preparing → on the way → delivered) |

### Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| flutter_bloc ^9.0.0 | State management (Cubit pattern) |
| equatable ^2.0.7 | Value equality for entities and states |
| get_it ^8.0.3 | Service locator / dependency injection |
| google_fonts ^8.0.2 | Poppins font family |
| cached_network_image ^3.4.1 | Image loading with caching and placeholders |
| intl ^0.19.0 | Currency formatting |

### Running

```bash
cd Q4/source/food_delivery_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### What I Would Improve

- Add unit tests for cubits (especially CartCubit's multi-restaurant logic and OrderCubit's timer)
- Add integration tests for the full checkout flow
- Replace mock `Future.delayed` with a proper repository pattern backed by a local database
- Add pull-to-refresh on restaurant list
- Add search/filter functionality
- Animated transitions between screens
